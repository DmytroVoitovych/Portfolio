## 🌟 Featured Creations

### 🎭 [Mood Tracking App](https://github.com/DmytroVoitovych/mood-app)
> *"Because understanding your emotions shouldn't be rocket science"*

**The Challenge:** How do you visualize something as abstract as human emotions?

**My Solution:** 
- 📊 Interactive 11-day trend charts that make patterns pop
- 💭 Smart mood quotes system powered by curated data
- 🧮 Median statistics that reveal emotional patterns
- 🎨 Beautiful avatar uploads with seamless third-party integration

**Tech Magic:** Vue.js + Element Plus + Firebase + Custom Date Logic
**Cool Detail:** Used `Intl.DateTimeFormat` to handle tricky date calculations across different environments - because dates are harder than they look! 📅

---

### 🏭 [Ioncor Operators Manager](https://github.com/DmytroVoitovych/ioncor-operators-manager)
> *"Turning production chaos into beautiful orchestration"*

**The Challenge:** How do you manage complex operator schedules without anyone getting bored?

**My Secret Sauce:**
- 🧠 Smart algorithm that creates the most diverse schedules possible
- 📡 Real-time tracking that updates faster than you can blink
- 🔐 Rock-solid authentication with role management
- 📱 Works flawlessly on everything from phones to factory tablets

**Tech Power:** Vue 3 + Pinia + TypeScript + Supabase + Pure Logic Magic
**Nerd Alert:** The scheduling algorithm minimizes repeats using mathematical rotation - it's like Sudoku, but for work shifts! 🧮

---

### 🎟️ [Conference Ticket Generator](https://github.com/DmytroVoitovych/Conference-ticket)
> *"Making conference tickets as exciting as the events themselves"*

**The Fun Factor:**
- 🎭 Silky smooth Anime.js animations that count up with style
- 📸 Drag-and-drop avatar uploads (because who doesn't love drag-and-drop?)
- ⌨️ Full keyboard navigation - accessibility is not optional!
- 🎨 CSS magic with clip-path and border-image

**Plot Twist:** Built with vanilla JavaScript because sometimes you don't need a framework to create magic! ✨

---

### 🧠 [Frontend Quiz App](https://github.com/DmytroVoitovych/Frontend-Quiz-app)
> *"Testing knowledge, one question at a time"*

**The Modern Touch:**
- ⚡ React 19 with the shiny new `useActionState` hook
- 🌓 Theme switching that remembers your preference
- 💾 Custom localStorage hook for persistent scores
- 🎯 Pixel-perfect validation with delightful feedback

**Geek Moment:** Used custom event dispatching instead of context - sometimes the simple solution is the elegant one! 🎪

---

### 📝 [DevNotes](https://github.com/DmytroVoitovych/DevNotes)

**The Complete Package:**
